# 📝 Write Up

For this challenge, we are given the following string: 

Vm14V1QxWldTblZqTTJoWlpXeEtNRmRJY0VaTlIwWTJWRzFhYTFaRmNEQlVWbEpUVDFFOVBRPT0=

From previous experience and intuition, this looks like base64. We decode this and get:

VmxWT1ZWSnVjM2hZZWxKMFdIcEZNR0Y2VG1aa1ZFcDBUVlJTT1E9PQ==

This looks like base64 again. We decode this and get: 

VlVOVVJuc3hYelJ0WHpFMGF6TmZkVEp0TVRSOQ==

This looks like base64 again. We decode this and get: 

VUNURnsxXzRtXzE0azNfdTJtMTR9

This looks like base64 again. We decode this and get:

UCTF{1_4m_14k3_u2m14}
